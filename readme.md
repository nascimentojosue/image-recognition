# Image Recognition System

This project is a simple image recognition system in Python, using the ResNet-50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Given an input image, the system predicts the object it most likely represents.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- `torch` and `torchvision` for the pre-trained model and transformations
- `Pillow` for image handling

### Install Dependencies

You can install the necessary libraries with:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
